When running the program, the user must select two folders; first, the training folder, where spam and ham folders are expected with corresponding emails inside each; and then a testing folder, where spam and ham folders are also expected with corresponding emails inside each.

After that, the program goes through the emails in the training folder and generates appropiate probability maps, to then go through the emials in the test folder and calculate the probability of each being spam or not.

<ins>Framework used / built with</ins>

We used IntelliJ to layout, organize and code the program.

And we used gradle to create an easier way to run it for anyone downloading it.

<ins>Installation / How to use?</ins>

For easy running, using any terminal where gradle is installed, navigate to the Project folder in the Repository and run gradle build.

<ins>Credit</ins>

For some of the classes in the program, mostly FileCounter.java and Probabilities.java, some code was taken from the module 5 course examples.

For the layout of the README we took inspiration from https://meakaakka.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3
