When running the program, the user must select two folders; first, the training folder, where spam and ham folders are expected with corresponding emails inside each; and then a testing folder, where spam and ham folders are also expected with corresponding emails inside each.

After that, the program goes through the emails in the training folder and generates appropiate probability maps, to then go through the emials in the test folder and calculate the probability of each being spam or not.

<ins>Framework used / built with</ins>

We used IntelliJ to layout, organize and code the program.

And we used the IntelliJ artifact to create an executable jar file.


<ins>Installation / How to use?</ins>

For easy running, run the Main.jar file in the repository.

Otherwise, using any terminal, starting from the repository folder, navigate to Project/out/production/Project and run: java sample.Main

<ins>Credit</ins>

For some of the classes in the program, mostly FileCounter.java and Probabilities.java, some functions and code structure was taken from the module 5 course examples, to be specific, from WordCount.java: parseFiles(file), isValid(word), coundWord(word).

For the layout of the README we took inspiration from https://meakaakka.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3
